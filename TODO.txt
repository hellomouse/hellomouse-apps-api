note: json merge will keep old keys, maybe just overwrite and keep defaults?

safe cors

limit size of metadata and settings jsons

config:
    limit board counts



limit password length

https://docs.rs/html_sanitizer/latest/html_sanitizer/

pin interact endpoint

pin metadata not working

checklist pins

edit perm can edit board, but cannot remove owners

add db constraint for user_id - alphanuermic


move routes to each module -> call configure for each

Name + desc should be stripped of HTML + length limited

write tests for public + 2 users

write list of tests for pins for 2 people


tests:
env variables, ...

better test config: api base path








future:
add ability to favorite boards / pins

make a file upload API
https://crates.io/crates/actix-multipart-extract
https://users.rust-lang.org/t/file-upload-in-actix-web/64871/3

better sorting for search results

API for updating PFP

idea of metadata:
- first user sets a "legal_keys": key -> an array
- future users add to the array

make parameter names all good, like create_account

tags or hashtags for notes
- detect hashtags and allow sorting by

locked - only owner can make modifications

trash users
