safe cors

limit size of metadata and settings jsons

config:
    limit board counts

limit password length

make pins flag actually order pins


https://docs.rs/html_sanitizer/latest/html_sanitizer/

pin interact endpoint


checklist pins

limit login attempts

endpoint for adding web pages maybe?

on timeout - instead of rejecting the request, return timeout


move routes to each module -> call configure for each

Name + desc should be stripped of HTML + length limited

write tests for public + 2 users

write list of tests for pins for 2 people


tests:
env variables, ...

better test config: api base path


don't re-generate the rules every time for htmlclean


future:
add ability to favorite boards / pins

make a file upload API
https://crates.io/crates/actix-multipart-extract
https://users.rust-lang.org/t/file-upload-in-actix-web/64871/3

better sorting for search results

API for updating PFP

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617
https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/password-authentication-in-rust/
https://libpasta.github.io/introduction/basic-usage/

idea of metadata:
- first user sets a "legal_keys": key -> an array
- future users add to the array

make parameter names all good, like create_account

tags or hashtags for notes
- detect hashtags and allow sorting by


trash users
